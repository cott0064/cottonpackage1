## 1 The mathematical derivation of the probability that two or more people in a class of size n have the same birthday (Use Latex only)

The probability that the total of all the birthdays $n$  are distinct is 

$P(A^c) = \dfrac{365 \cdot 364 \cdots (365-n+1)}{365^n}$

Since the there are only two options (that a birthday is shared or not)

$P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$

Therefore, the probability that at least two people share a birthday is 

$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$

or

$P(A) = 1 - \dfrac{365 \cdot 364 \cdots (365-n+1)}{365^n}$



## 2 The reformulation of this probability using lfactorial and lchoose (You may use the picture below)

## 3 [After packaging the birthday function and documenting it] Show the body of the function 
```{r}
# here is the body of the function that I made
birthday <- function(x){
  1 - exp(lchoose(365, x) + lfactorial(x) - x*log(365))
}
```

## 4 birthday(n = 20:25) (Run in an R chunk)

```{r setup}
birthday(20:25)
```
